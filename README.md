# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in C\#

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

All solutions in this repository were developed solely by me, without the use of any large language models (LLMs) or artificial intelligence (AI) tools. I have not used any external assistance for solving these challenges. Each day corresponds to a unique problem, and all solutions are implemented in C#.

Please note that some solutions are implemented better than others. Feel free to explore the repository, learn from my approach, or challenge yourself by attempting the problems on your own!
